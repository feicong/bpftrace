.SH NAME
biostacks \- Show disk I/O latency with initialization stacks. Uses bpftrace/eBPF.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B biostacks
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool shows disk I/O latency histograms for each block I/O initialization
path. This can help reveal the reason for different latencies, as some may
be created by log flushing, others by application reads, etc.

This works by attaching to block_io_start and block_rq_issue tracepoints.

Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
CONFIG_BPF and bpftrace.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Trace disk I/O latency with initialization stacks:
#
.B biostacks.bt
.SH FIELDS
.TP
0th
An initialization kernel stack trace (shown in "@[...]") is printed before each I/O histogram.
.TP
1st, 2nd
This is a range of I/O latency, in microseconds (shown in "[...)" set notation).
.TP
3rd
A column showing the count of I/O in this range.
.TP
4th
This is an ASCII histogram representing the count column.
.SH OVERHEAD
The rate of biostacks should be low (bounded by device IOPS), such that
the overhead of this tool is expected to be negligible.
